# Validation for GitOps approach

## Preparation
The GitOps approach deploys two tenants: MHR and BHS. There are two namespaces mhr-orthweb and bhs-orthweb, both of which should be tested.

The first step is to make sure DNS resolution works. If you're on a Sandbox cluster such as Minikube, you may have to mock DNS resolution to ingress IP by adding the following entries to `/etc/hosts`:
```sh
192.168.64.16 web.bhs.orthweb.com
192.168.64.16 dicom.bhs.orthweb.com
192.168.64.17 web.mhr.orthweb.com
192.168.64.17 dicom.mhr.orthweb.com
```

## Generate client certificate
Take BHS tenant as an example, we first create a client certificate for use later.
```sh
# bhs: generate client key pair
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -subj /C=CA/ST=Ontario/L=Waterloo/O=Digihunch/OU=Imaging/CN=dcmclient.bhs.orthweb.com/emailAddress=dcmclient@digihunch.com -keyout bhs.client.key -out bhs.client.csr

# bhs: export intermediate CA credentials
kubectl -n bhs-orthweb get secret int-ca-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.key}' | base64 -d > bhs.int.ca.key
kubectl -n bhs-orthweb get secret int-ca-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}' | base64 -d > bhs.int.ca.crt

# bhs: get intermediate CA to sign client cert 
openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 365 -in bhs.client.csr -CA bhs.int.ca.crt -CAkey bhs.int.ca.key -set_serial 01 -out bhs.client.crt
```

## Validate web service
Take BHS tenant as an example, we can test web service with curl command as below:
```sh
# bhs: validate web request (without client certificate)
curl -HHost:web.bhs.orthweb.com -k -X GET https://web.bhs.orthweb.com:443/app/explorer.html -u admin:orthanc --cacert bhs.int.ca.crt
```
Alternatively we can browse to the URL. However, the browser may flag the self-signed certificate as insecure.

## Validate DICOM service
Take BHS tenant as an example, we can test DICOM C-ECHO and C-STORE with the following commands:
```sh
# bhs: validate DICOM c-echo request (with client certificate)
echoscu -aet TESTER -aec ORTHANC -d +tls bhs.client.key bhs.client.crt -rc +cf bhs.int.ca.crt dicom.bhs.orthweb.com 11112

# bhs: validate DICOM c-store request (with client certificate)
storescu -aet TESTER -aec ORTHANC -d +tls bhs.client.key bhs.client.crt -rc +cf bhs.int.ca.crt dicom.bhs.orthweb.com 11112 DICOM_CT/0001.dcm
```

## Verify Observability
To check Pod logs, use Kiali. We can use port-forward to expose kiali service.
```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/kiali -n monitoring 8080:20001
```
